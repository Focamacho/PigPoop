This mod allows pigs to poop! Pigs produce poop as often as chickens lay eggs.
If a poop is not collected from the ground within 290 seconds, it will disappear and attempt to fertilize the ground.

Poops can also be used as a substitute for Bone Meal. Normal poops are 2x better than bone meal.
You can feed the pigs with Golden Carrot so that they produce Golden Poop. Golden poops are 20x better than bone meal.
